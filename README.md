### My solutions to the mini problems of the memory game. Solutions are just my first try at making each part functional. Still needs to be refactored and has many bugs. Just to give students an idea about one way to approach the problem and encourage questions. There are many ways to approach these problems, try it out and work a little bit everyday!! Keep working hard fenders!
